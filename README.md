(The files named program.cs are the actual code I wrote, the other code is aoutomaticly added by Visual Studio.)

### Daily Report
A simple console app that asks a few questions for students of The Tech Academy to give a daily report.
It prints the questions in the console. gets the input from the user and stores the answer as a corresponding data-type.

This is an Aplication that compares the incom of 2 persons by hourly rate and weekly working hours. 
It uses user input, math operations and type casting to do so.
