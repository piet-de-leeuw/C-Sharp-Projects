## BLACKJACK_application
This is a project I am working on. making a Black Jack Game.

## Basic_C#_Programs
In the Basic_C#_Project folder you find some simple console apps I made:
(The files named program.cs are the actual code I wrote, the other code is aoutomaticly added by Visual Studio.)

### Inherit_Class
In this project I made multiple classes and let one inherit from the other.  

### Method_exercise
In this project I did some exercises with methods in the program.cs class and in a seperated class.

### FunctionOverload
In this Project I created multiple overloades from a function it can take in Intergers, decimals and string values.
I creaded the functions in a seperate class (called MathOverloades) and call them in the Main function from program.cs.

I updated the project with a function with an optional parameter.

### Functions_Math
In this project I Created 3 functions in a seperated class (Called My_Function), that perform math operations.
In the main function of program.cs I call the functions to modify the inputed number. 

### Daily Report
A simple console app that asks a few questions for students of The Tech Academy to give a daily report.
It prints the questions in the console. gets the input from the user and stores the answer as a corresponding data-type.

### Anonymous_Income_Comprison_Program
This is an Aplication that compares the incom of 2 persons by hourly rate and weekly working hours. 
It uses user input, math operations and type casting to do so. 

### Qualify_For_Car_Insurance
This is an app that checks if you qualify for a car insurance. ist uses boolean logic.

### Get_Shipping_Quote
This app calculates the schipping price for packages and decides if a package is to big. It use if else statements to do so.

### Math_Application
This is a simple app using math operators.

### ChooseFromArrayAndList
This app lets you choose from the index of an srtin array, int array and a string list and returns the values on that index.

### Arrays_Lists
In this exsercise I used arrays and loops to search throug arrays. Add and append strings in arrays, search for double words in arrays, ect.
