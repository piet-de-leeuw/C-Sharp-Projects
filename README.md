## BLACKJACK_application
This Project is a BlackJack Console Game. It impelments most of the techniques in the Bacic C# projects.
<br>*[source code](BLACKJACK_application/BLACKJACK_application)*

## WPF_Applications

### WPF_Exercise
This is an exercise where I build a small todo list app. It has a simple GUI and Add and remove functionality.

## Basic_C#_Programs
In the Basic_C#_Project folder you find some simple console apps I made:

### OperatorOverload
In this project I use opreator overloads to make it eassy to compare employees by id with the == opperator. 
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/OperatorOverload/OperatorOverload)*

### LambdaExpresions
In this exercice I use Lamba expresions to Query a list.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/LambdaExpresions/LambdaExpresions)*

### Interface_IQuittable
this project Implements and uses an interface. I also use polimorphism to morph a class into a Interface it inherits from.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Interface_IQuittable/Interface_IQuittable)*

### Generic_Class
Implemented an app that parses user input to a enum DayOfTheWeek
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Generic_Class/Generic_Class)*

### ParseEnums
In this project I use convertion to parse user input to an enum. 
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/ParseEnums/ParseEnums)*

### ExceptionHandeling
In this project I use try and catchblocks to Handle exeption.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/ExceptionHandeling/ExceptionHandeling)*

### Inherit_Class
In this project I made multiple classes and let one inherit from the other.  
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Inherit_Class)*

### Method_exercise
In this project I did some exercises with methods in the program.cs class and in a seperated class.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Method_exercise/Method_exercise)*

### FunctionOverload
In this Project I created multiple overloades from a function it can take in Intergers, decimals and string values.
I creaded the functions in a seperate class (called MathOverloades) and call them in the Main function from program.cs.

I updated the project with a function with an optional parameter.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/FunctionOverload/FunctionOverload)*

### Functions_Math
In this project I Created 3 functions in a seperated class (Called My_Function), that perform math operations.
In the main function of program.cs I call the functions to modify the inputed number. 
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Functions_Math)*

### Daily Report
A simple console app that asks a few questions for students of The Tech Academy to give a daily report.
It prints the questions in the console. gets the input from the user and stores the answer as a corresponding data-type.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/DailyReport/DailyReport)*

### Anonymous_Income_Comprison_Program
This is an Aplication that compares the incom of 2 persons by hourly rate and weekly working hours. 
It uses user input, math operations and type casting to do so. 
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Anonymous_Income_Comprison_Program/Anonymous_Income_Comprison_Program)*

### Qualify_For_Car_Insurance
This is an app that checks if you qualify for a car insurance. ist uses boolean logic.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Qualify_For_Car_Insurance/Qualify_For_Car_Insurance)*

### Get_Shipping_Quote
This app calculates the schipping price for packages and decides if a package is to big. It use if else statements to do so.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Get_Shipping_Quote)*

### Math_Application
This is a simple app using math operators.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Math_Application/Math_Application)*

### ChooseFromArrayAndList
This app lets you choose from the index of an srtin array, int array and a string list and returns the values on that index.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/ChooseFromArrayAndList/ChooseFromArrayAndList)*

### Arrays_Lists
In this exsercise I used arrays and loops to search throug arrays. Add and append strings in arrays, search for double words in arrays, ect.
<br>*[source code](Basic_C-Sharp_Programs/Arrays_Lists)*
